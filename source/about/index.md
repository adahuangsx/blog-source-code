#### Why this course (INFSCI 2470)

I believe most of us would think **HCI** is closely related to the front-end design, but I think <u>*this course may be also necessary to the developers from any fields*</u>. Because programmers always need to know well about the users' perspective. 

I don't view this course as others like the Web Developing course, and I hope to **design more user-friendly systems in the future** after taking this course.
