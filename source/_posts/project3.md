â€‹	We are going to implement  8 chips in this project.

## The Chips to implement

### 1-Bit Register Chip

**Tip:** It can be built from a DFF and a multiplexor.

---

### 16-Bit Register

**Tip:** A little bit different wiring from the last one.

---

### 8-Register Chip

This is the first RAM device consisting of 8 registers. Here is its API:

```vhdl
CHIP RAM8 {
	IN in[16], load, address[3];
	OUT out[16];
}
```

**Tips:**

1. We need to feed the `in` value to all the 8 registers simultaneously. 
2. Then use the Mux or DeMux chips to select the one to operate.

---

### RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K,RAM16K

**Tips:**

As we started the last RAM8, we can stack the small RAM chip to larger ones, grouping them layer by layer.

Think about the `address` input as consisting of 2 fields: one to select the RAM, the other to select the register.

---

### Program Counter

**Tip:** It can be built from a register, an incrementor and other taught gates.

## Some Questions

**Q. Why there are 2 folders `a/` and `b/` in Project 3 directory?**

A. The larger RAMs, like RAM16K, are built from smaller ones down to the Bit Register, so it will involves a huge recursion. This will be too much for a humble simulator to handle. Therefore, we are supposed to use the built-in Java implementations, which makes it faster and smoother.

**Q. We take the Flip Flop as a black box in this course. How is it implemented in real?**

A. The core is 2 NAND Gates connected in a loop. A change in a moment can decide the output in the future.

Above shows how gate maintains "memory". Of course the outer layer is necessary for the DFF functionality.

## While Doing It

* HDL is a description language not a programming language. It is OK to input a new pin name, which appears in the line below, to **implement the circle** between gates.
